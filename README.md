# Reinforcement-Learning-Mini-Project
Project Description: This project provides a hands-on implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied to the domain of robotic control. The goal is to train an intelligent agent to learn complex manipulation tasks directly from pixel observations or low-level state data within a realistic simulation environment.

Using Panda-Gym—a reinforcement learning benchmark library based on the PyBullet physics engine—we simulate a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm. The agent's objective is to learn a policy (a mapping from states to actions) that maximizes a reward signal, successfully completing tasks through continuous interaction with its environment.

Key Tasks Implemented:
Reach: Guide the robot's end-effector to a target location in 3D space.
Push: Manipulate an object to push it to a designated target position.
Pick and Place: Grasp a object and lift it to place it accurately onto a target.

Technical Stack:
Language: Python
Libraries: Panda-Gym, PyBullet

Learning Outcomes:
Gained practical experience with core RL concepts: agents, environments, states, actions, rewards, and policies.
Developed skills in implementing, training, and evaluating state-of-the-art Deep RL algorithms.
Understood the challenges of training in simulation, including reward shaping, hyperparameter tuning, and interpreting learning curves.
Built a foundation for solving complex, high-dimensional control problems prevalent in robotics and autonomous systems.
