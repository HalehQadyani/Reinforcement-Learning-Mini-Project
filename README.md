# Reinforcement-Learning-Mini-Project
Project Description: This project provides a hands-on implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied to the domain of robotic control. The goal is to train an intelligent agent to learn complex manipulation tasks directly from pixel observations or low-level state data within a realistic simulation environment.

Using Panda-Gym—a reinforcement learning benchmark library based on the PyBullet physics engine—we simulate a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm. The agent's objective is to learn a policy (a mapping from states to actions) that maximizes a reward signal, successfully completing tasks through continuous interaction with its environment.
