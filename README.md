# Reinforcement-Learning-Mini-Project
Project Description: This project provides a hands-on implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied to the domain of robotic control. The goal is to train an intelligent agent to learn complex manipulation tasks directly from pixel observations or low-level state data within a realistic simulation environment.
